This is a placeholder file for the assets directory.

In a real project, this directory would contain:
- images/ - Background images, character sprites, UI elements
- audio/ - Sound effects, background music, voice files
- fonts/ - TTF/OTF font files

The build system will:
1. Scan this directory for all asset files
2. Process and optimize them based on type
3. Pack them into .nmres resource files
4. Apply encryption if enabled (release builds)
